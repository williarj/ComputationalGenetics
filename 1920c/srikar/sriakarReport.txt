For My Data:
I simulated my model pretty closely with professor Williamson's model. The big change that I did was dramatically alter the mutation rate. After 200 generations, I increased the mutation rate by a factor of 10^2. 
I know the split times didn't violate the assumption because it occurred after a very long time(2000 generations). The assumption of dN/dS test is that sites are assumed independent and non-interacting. With 2000 generations, it's good to assume that the two populations are independent and non-interacting. After all of the calculations, within the population I had 589 non-synonymous values and 679 synonymous values. So my Pn/Ps value is 1.50. Between the two species I had 1450 non-synonymous values and 961 synonymous values. So my dN/dS value is 0.871. Since Pn/Ps is greater than dN/dS, we know that this is negative selection. It's not surprising especially since I increased the mutation rate.
