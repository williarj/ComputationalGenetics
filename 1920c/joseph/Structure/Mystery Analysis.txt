Mystery1:
1. There are 4 populations
2. One of them is slightly larger than the other three.
3. One of them has a really low migration rate (possibly 0), the yellow one has a relatively high migration rate with the red one, and the blue population has a bit of everything.

Mystery2:
1. There are 8 populations
2. The blue one is significantly larger than all other populations.
3. 4 of the 8 populations have really low migration rate while the other three has really high migration rate.

Mystery3:
1. There are 10 populations
2. The red and orange are significantly larger than all others
3. 5 of the 10 populations have really low migration rate while the other 5 has really high migration rate.
