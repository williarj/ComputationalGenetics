From the PCA diagram it can be seen that group 1 and 2 are very mixed at most of the locations, whereas group 3 are isolated in one place.
This shows the effect of the migration rate of population 2.
Similarly in the structure diagram (mine is sorted by Q), It can be seen that one population has a strong mix between the blue and green where as red is mostly just red.
In my simulation Ln p(d) is the highest when K=3, which corresponds to the setup.
