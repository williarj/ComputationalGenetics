In this model I simulated a pollution that splits off after 2500 generations much like the one in the file provided. I changed the mutation rate of the both populations during the same time as they split to increase to 2x10^-5 from 1x10^-6 increased the mutation rate by 20 which should be a very significant change. In SLim this is reflected as well as the model slows down after the mutation rate has been altered. The assumptions for the Dn/Ds test should not be violated by this because the time difference between the split covered 2500 generations which is greater than anything that should cause errors in the analysis.
