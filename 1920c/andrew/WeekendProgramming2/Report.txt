I simulated a population identical to the one simulated in class, with the exception that it has less of a negative effect (selection coefficient -0.004) and that it has a dominance coefficient of 0.25. My hypothesis was that these two additional characteristics would about cancel each other out, which appeared to have been confirmed with a glance at the proportion of m1's to m2's. I attempted to ensure that the split times did not violate the assumptions made in the computation of dn/ds by using a small population; as I remember, the assumptions are fulfilled if T>=4N. If the population were larger or the split time smaller, the assumption would be broken and each metric would likely be undercounting as a result of insufficient time to randomly develop mutations. My data yields a dN/dS of about 0.57 and a pN/pS of about .49, likely a statistically significant difference, but not altogether absurd. Both values indicate negative selection, but not an extreme amount thereof.
